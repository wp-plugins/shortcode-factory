== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why [scf-register-link] is not showing a register link, while I am logged out? =

The "Register" link is not offered if the Administration > Settings > General > Membership: 'Anyone can register' box is not checked.

= Why [scf-register-link] is not working with WPMU? =

On WordPressMU, there is no /wp-register.php file, and /wp-login.php?action=register is not a valid registration form. Thus, wp_register function does not show a registration link.

= Does this plugin has a known conflict with Wordpress or other plugins? =

Although, we have tested it in very much detail. But technically, it shouldnâ€™t create a conflict, since it does not try to change anything in the Wordpress System.

= What if I use another short code in [scf-allow]...[/scf-allow]? =

[scf-allow] supports "short code within short code", so your other short codes in an [scf-allow]...[/scf-allow] block are rendered pretty fine.

== Screenshots ==

1. Plenty of short codes
2. Every short code has different attributes and options
3. Insert anywhere in a Post or Page
4. Works as expected, see it in action on front website
