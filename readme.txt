== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin has a known conflict with Wordpress or other plugins? =

Although, we have tested it in very much detail. But technically, it shouldnâ€™t create a conflict, since it does not try to change anything in the Wordpress System.

= What if I use another short code in [scf-allow]...[/scf-allow]? =

[scf-allow] supports "short code within short code", so your other short codes in an [scf-allow]...[/scf-allow] block are rendered pretty fine.

== Screenshots ==

1. Plenty of short codes
2. Every short code has different attributes and options
3. Insert anywhere in a Post or Page
4. Works as expected, see it in action on front website
